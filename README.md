# Classification-with-Feature-Selection
 The code is written in Python 3 on Google Colab notebook. Implements Machine Learning techniques to improve classification. Implemented Feature selection techniques on a number of gear datasets. Improved Accuracy and F measure of Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-nn classifiers by working only with selected features. Implemented k-fold Nested Cross-validation to divide the data into Train, Test and Validation sets in order to tune the hyper parameters of the algorithms. The Feature selection techniques are graph based techniques: Eigen Vector Centrality Feature Selection (ECFS), etc.
